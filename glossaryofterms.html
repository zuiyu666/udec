<dl class="glossary docutils">
<dt id="term-active-pane"><strong>active pane</strong></dt>
<dd>At any time, there will be a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-pane"><span class="xref std std-term">pane</span></a> in focus in the program, which is termed the <em>active</em> pane.  The <em>File</em> menu, toolbar, and <em>Control Panel</em> will all be furnished with options specific to the active pane’s <a class="reference internal" href="#term-pane-type"><span class="xref std std-term">pane type</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-alias"><strong>alias</strong></dt>
<dd>An alternative name given to a plot item or an element of a plot item.  When an item has an alias, the alias, rather than the item’s base name, is used as the text label that identifies the item in the plot’s legend.</dd>
<dt id="term-attribute"><strong>attribute</strong></dt>
<dd>An attribute (sometimes also called a “switch”) is a control that affects the display of a plot item by controlling
an aspect of the item’s appearance or display (e.g., transparency, color, size). In <span class="codename">UDEC</span>, each plot item has a
list of attributes that affect its appearance.</dd>
<dt id="term-bitmap"><strong>bitmap</strong></dt>
<dd>A bitmap (more correctly and broadly termed a raster image) is a rectangular image composed of pixels. There are many
bitmap file formats. <span class="codename">UDEC</span> can generate Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Windows Bitmap (BMP) file types. Contrast
this to vector image.</dd>
<dt id="term-boundary-condition"><strong>boundary condition</strong></dt>
<dd>A boundary condition is the prescription of a constraint or controlled condition along a model boundary (e.g., a fixed displacement or force for mechanical problems, an impermeable boundary for groundwater flow problems, adiabatic boundary for heat transfer problems, etc.).</dd>
<dt id="term-bundle-file"><strong>bundle file</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>bundle file</em> is generated using the <a class="reference internal" href="program_guide/mechanics/projects/bundle/createbundle.html#bundlecreate"><span class="std std-ref">Bundle</span></a> tool (<span class="menuselection">Tools ‣ Bundle</span>).  It gathers the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-project-file"><span class="xref std std-term">project file</span></a>, all input files tracked by it, and the record stripped from all model save states.  This is a simple and convenient method for archiving projects.  It is also a very useful attachment to <a class="reference internal" href="program_guide/support/technicalsupportdialog.html#thetechnicalsupportdialog"><span class="std std-ref">technical support requests</span></a>, since all resources needed to re-create the reported issue are made available to the support provider.</dd>
<dt id="term-call"><strong>CALL</strong></dt>
<dd><strong>CALL</strong> is a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> command (available either at the command prompt or via the <em>File</em> menu) that opens and executes a
data file in <span class="codename">UDEC</span>.</dd>
<dt id="term-command-prompt"><strong>command prompt</strong></dt>
<dd>The bottom part of the <span class="flag4">i</span> <a class="reference internal" href="program_guide/mechanics/commands/console_pane/consolepane.html#theconsolepane"><span class="std std-ref">Console</span></a> pane, composed of a prompt (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">udec&gt;</span></code> ) and an edit field where commands may be entered.</dd>
<dt id="term-41"><strong>command prompt</strong></dt>
<dd>The command prompt is used to enter commands in <span class="codename">UDEC</span>, line by line. It appears in the bottom of the <em>Console</em> pane.
<span class="codename">UDEC</span> output responses to commands entered at the prompt are displayed in the <em>Console</em> pane above it.</dd>
<dt id="term-console"><strong>console</strong></dt>
<dd>A generic reference to the <span class="flag4">i</span> <a class="reference internal" href="program_guide/mechanics/commands/console_pane/consolepane.html#theconsolepane"><span class="std std-ref">Console</span></a> pane.  The term refers to any text-based command-processing application.  As command-driven software, Itasca programs have a console.  In some cases it may be referred to generically this way in the program documentation (“… in the console …”).</dd>
<dt id="term-42"><strong>Console (pane)</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>Console</em> pane contains the command prompt and the display area appearing above it. Output messages from <span class="codename">UDEC</span>
appear in the display area as commands at the prompt (or from data files) are processed. Unlike <em>View</em> and <em>Editor</em>
panes, there is only one instance of the <em>Console</em> pane in the <span class="codename">UDEC</span> interface. See the topic
Overview: Console for further information.</dd>
<dt id="term-console-pane"><strong>Console pane</strong></dt>
<dd>This pane is divided into two parts. The bottom of the pane is the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-41"><span class="xref std std-term">command prompt</span></a>, where users may enter commands one at a time.  The upper part of the pane (variously referred to as the output, the output window, the console output, etc.) echoes commands and prints written output resulting from command processing.  The <em>Options</em> dialog provides options for which output and how much of it will be displayed in the output.</dd>
<dt id="term-constitutive-model"><strong>constitutive model</strong></dt>
<dd>The constitutive (or material) model represents the deformation and strength behavior prescribed to the zones in a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model. Several constitutive models to assimilate different types of behavior commonly associated with geologic materials are available in <span class="codename">UDEC</span>. Constitutive models and material properties can be assigned individually to every zone in a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model.</dd>
<dt id="term-control-panel"><strong>Control Panel</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>Control Panel</em> is a pane that contains tools for working with <em>Views</em>. These tools are grouped into control sets.
In <span class="codename">UDEC</span> 6.0, the <em>Control Panel</em> is used only in conjunction with <em>View</em> panes or the <em>Extrusion</em> pane.</dd>
<dt id="term-control-set"><strong>control set</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>Control Panel</em> has three control sets available to it: <em>Plot Items</em>, which is used to specify plot items
(and their switches) for display in a <em>View</em> pane; <em>View Information</em>, which displays model information relative to
the current location of the mouse cursor; and <em>View Controls</em>, which provides tools for manipulation (zoom, rotate,
magnify etc.) of the model view. Display of each control set within the <em>Control Panel</em> may be toggled off/on.
In addition, the control sets may be subdivided into components that may be displayed/minimized within the <em>Control Panel</em>.</dd>
<dt id="term-cycle"><strong>cycle</strong></dt>
<dd>A cycle refers to the unit of model time it takes to complete the calculations in one timestep. Also may be referred
to as “step.”</dd>
<dt id="term-data-file"><strong>data file</strong></dt>
<dd>Program commands may be issued “interactively” at the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-41"><span class="xref std std-term">command prompt</span></a>, or via a <em>data file</em>. The data file is a formatted ASCII file created by the user, which contains the set of commands that represents the problem being analyzed. In general, creating data files is the more efficient modeling method. Data files are opened and the commands within them are executed by the program using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/program/commands/cmd_program.call.html#command:program.call" title="command:program call"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">program</span> <span class="pre">call</span></code></a> command, or via the <span class="menuselection">File ‣ Open Item…</span> menu command. Though data files can have any file name and any extension, it is recommended that a common extension (e.g., “.UDDAT” for <span class="codename">UDEC</span> data input commands or “.FIS” for <span class="codename">FISH</span> function statements be used to distinguish these files from other types of files.</dd>
<dt id="term-46"><strong>data file</strong></dt>
<dd>A text file containing <span class="codename">UDEC</span> commands. As one data file can call another (via the <strong>CALL</strong> command or <span class="codename">FISH</span>), several
data files may be linked. See the topic The Editor Pane for information on working with and executing data files.</dd>
<dt id="term-dock"><strong>dock</strong></dt>
<dd>The term “dock” means to place a pane or toolbar in a fixed location within the interface. See also “float.”</dd>
<dt id="term-dynamic-solution"><strong>dynamic solution</strong></dt>
<dd>For a dynamic solution, the full dynamic equations of motion (including inertial terms) are solved; the generation and dissipation of kinetic energy directly affect the solution. Dynamic solutions are required for problems involving high frequency and short duration loads (e.g., seismic or explosive loading).</dd>
<dt id="term-editor-pane"><strong>Editor (pane)</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>Editor</em> pane provides the facility to work with (create, edit, validate) data files. Each instance of the <em>Editor</em>
pane holds one file; multiple instances of the pane (and thus multiple files) may be open at once. Any text file may be
loaded into the pane. See the topic Overview: Editor for more information.</dd>
<dt id="term-finite-volume-grid"><strong>finite volume grid</strong></dt>
<dd>The finite volume grid is an assemblage of one or more finite volume zones across the physical region that is being analyzed. Another term for grid is mesh. The finite difference grid also identifies the storage locations of all state variables in the model. In general, all the vector quantities (e.g., forces, velocities, and displacements) are stored at gridpoint locations, while all scalar and tensor quantities (e.g., stress and material properties) are stored at zone centroid locations.</dd>
<dt id="term-fish-file"><strong>FISH (file)</strong></dt>
<dd><span class="codename">FISH</span> is the embedded scripting language of <span class="codename">UDEC</span>. It may be used to define new functions and variables to extend
<span class="codename">UDEC</span>’s capabilities and to create user-defined features. A <span class="codename">FISH</span> file stores one or more <span class="codename">FISH</span> functions that may
be run by command from a data file.</dd>
<dt id="term-fish-i-o-file"><strong>fish i/o file</strong></dt>
<dd>A user-written <span class="codename">FISH</span> function may create, write, and read files (see the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../fish/doc/fish_manual/fish_fish/fish_fish.html#fish-file"><span class="std std-ref">FISH Functions</span></a> section for file input/output) of two forms. If the binary form is selected, the exact binary representation of a <span class="codename">FISH</span> variable is stored on file. If the ASCII form is selected, numeric or character data may be written, or read from, a file. The latter form is a useful way to process ASCII data in a nonstandard way on file.</dd>
<dt id="term-float"><strong>float</strong></dt>
<dd>The term “float” means to place a pane or toolbar in a detached position “above” or “outside” the main <span class="codename">UDEC</span> window.
Also see “dock.”</dd>
<dt id="term-geometry-file"><strong>geometry file</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>geometry file</em> is a set of nodes, edges, or polygons in space.   Sometimes this is referred to as CAD data.   This data could have originated from other sources.   <span class="codename">UDEC</span> currently recognizes three geometry file formations: DXF, STL, or GEOM.  The first two are industry standards, the last is an Itasca-specific format that preserves object meta-data (<span class="codename">FISH</span> extra variable assignment and/or group assignments).</dd>
<dt id="term-grid-file"><strong>grid (file)</strong></dt>
<dd>A grid file is an ASCII file containing the description of coordinates of gridpoints, which gridpoints make up each
zone, and which zones make up each group. It may be imported into <span class="codename">UDEC</span> to make a grid (see next).</dd>
<dt id="term-grid-term"><strong>grid (term)</strong></dt>
<dd>A grid is a geometric domain composed of zones and is the principal object in a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model. Grids may be created
using <span class="codename">UDEC</span> commands or imported from a grid file using the <em>File</em> menu.</dd>
<dt id="term-gridpoint"><strong>gridpoint</strong></dt>
<dd>Gridpoints are associated with the corners of the finite difference zones. There are three gridpoints associated with each  zone. Other terms for gridpoint are nodal point and node, but these are generally reserved for structural elements for clarity.</dd>
<dt id="term-group"><strong>group</strong></dt>
<dd>A group in a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model refers to a name that can be assigned to one or more objects.  Group names are assigned in a category, called <em>slots</em>, with the constraint that in a given object, each slot can only have one group assigned at a time.   An object may have many different group names, each in different slots.  As compared with a range, groups will always refer to specific model objects. Groups provide a way to persistently “name” parts of the model, and subsequently operate with ease on those parts of the model by applying that name to the range keyword in commands (e.g., consider <span class="cmdkey">zone cmodel assign mohr-coulomb range group &quot;Layer1&quot;</span>, which, as can be guessed, assigns the Mohr-Coulomb model to the zones in the group “Layer1”).</dd>
<dt id="term-history-file"><strong>history file</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>history file</em> is a formatted ASCII file created at the user’s request when issuing the command <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/history_manual/history_commands/cmd_history.export.html#command:history.export" title="command:history export"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">history</span> <span class="pre">export</span></code></a> command.  The user may specify a name for the file using the <span class="cmdkey">file</span> keyword of the command; if not, the default name “UDEC.HIS” is used.  Commands for creating history files may be issued interactively or within data files. A record of the history values is written to the file, which can be examined using any text editor that can access formatted ASCII files. Alternatively, the file may be processed by a commercial graph-plotting or spreadsheet package.</dd>
<dt id="term-id-number"><strong>id number</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Some individual elements of a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model may be identified by identification (ID) numbers.  These are unique numbers that are assigned by the code allowing the user to identify specific elements in a model. Elements that have IDs supply a <span class="cmdkey">list</span> keyword that is used to return ID-sorted data about the object. <span class="flag3">can’t use the following until it is common: (for example, try :cmd:’zone.list.information’).</span></p>
<p class="last">Component identification (<span class="cmdkey">component-id</span>) numbers are also assigned to individual elements of a structural element entity. A unique component-id number is created for each node, and element that make up a beam, cable, rockbolt, or support entity.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-index-number"><strong>index number</strong></dt>
<dd>Similar to an id, all individual elements of a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model may be identified by the index number.  This number refers to the location in a memory array that stores all <span class="codename">UDEC</span> objects.</dd>
<dt id="term-initial-conditions"><strong>initial conditions</strong></dt>
<dd>This is the state of all variables in the model (e.g., stresses or pore pressures) prior to any loading change or disturbance (e.g., excavation).</dd>
<dt id="term-item"><strong>item</strong></dt>
<dd>“Item” is a term that refers generically to any individual file used in, or created by, a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> project. This may
include data files, <span class="codename">FISH</span> files, SAV files, plot files, grid files, and more. See
Overview: Projects for an introduction to projects. See
The Project Pane for information on working with projects.</dd>
<dt id="term-large-strain-small-strain"><strong>large strain/small strain</strong></dt>
<dd>By default, <span class="codename">UDEC</span> operates in large-strain mode; gridpoint coordinates are updated at each step according to computed displacements. In large-strain mode, geometric nonlinearity is possible.</dd>
<dt id="term-layout"><strong>layout</strong></dt>
<dd>The current configuration of the panes, menus, and toolbars in <span class="codename">UDEC</span> is the “layout.” The layout is saved with the
project; <span class="codename">UDEC</span> restores that layout when the project is (re)opened. The current layout may be saved by the user and
subsequently applied to a project that uses a different layout. See the
Layouts and Working with Panes topics for more information.</dd>
<dt id="term-legend"><strong>legend</strong></dt>
<dd>All plots contain a legend. The information appearing on the legend is configured through the <em>Legend</em> plot item.</dd>
<dt id="term-listing-pane"><strong>Listing (pane)</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>Listing</em> pane is created any time a <strong>LIST</strong> command is used that generates textual output exceeding a specified
number of lines. That threshold value is set in the <em>Listings</em> section of the <em>Options</em> dialog. Output under the
threshold is displayed in the <em>Console</em>; output over the threshold is put into a new, automatically created <em>Listing</em> pane.</dd>
<dt id="term-log-file"><strong>log file</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>log file</em> is a formatted ASCII file that captures all output text from the <em>Console</em> pane. The log file is useful in providing a record of the <span class="codename">UDEC</span> work session; it also provides a document for quality-assurance purposes.  The file is created/maintained if the command <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/program/commands/cmd_program.log.html#command:program.log" title="command:program log"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">program</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code></a> is set <a class="reference internal" href="../../utilities/types.html#type:bool" title="type:bool"><span class="varstringbool"><span class="null">on</span></span></a>.  The user may supply a file name using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/program/commands/cmd_program.log-file.html#command:program.log-file" title="command:program log-file"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">program</span> <span class="pre">log-file</span></code></a> command; if the command is not given but logging is on, the default file name “UDEC.LOG” will be used.</dd>
<dt id="term-main-menu"><strong>main menu</strong></dt>
<dd>There is only one menu in the program, located immediately beneath the program title bar.</dd>
<dt id="term-model"><strong>model</strong></dt>
<dd>The model (or <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model) is created by the user to simulate a physical problem. When referring to a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model, the user implies a sequence of <span class="codename">UDEC</span> commands (see the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../udec/docproject/source/elements/udeccommandsandfish.html#udeccommandsandfish"><span class="std std-ref">UDEC Commands and FISH</span></a> section) that define the problem conditions for numerical solution.</dd>
<dt id="term-model-boundary"><strong>model boundary</strong></dt>
<dd>The model boundary is the periphery of the finite difference grid. Internal boundaries (i.e., holes within the grid) are also model boundaries.</dd>
<dt id="term-model-state"><strong>model state</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">The model state is all the information the program holds in computer memory at this moment regarding the computational model. A <a class="reference internal" href="#term-save-file"><span class="xref std std-term">save file</span></a> — which may also be called a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-saved-state"><span class="xref std std-term">saved state</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="#term-sav-file"><span class="xref std std-term">sav file</span></a> — is a stored model state.  Also see <a class="reference internal" href="#term-program-state"><span class="xref std std-term">program state</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-project-state"><span class="xref std std-term">project state</span></a>.  The model state contains the following.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>all model objects and all custom data stored with them (in extra variables)</li>
<li>all auxiliary entities (geometries, DFNs, etc.)</li>
<li>all intermediate model objects (extrusion sets and building block sets in <span class="codename">FLAC3D</span>, clump templates in <span class="codename">PFC</span>, etc.)</li>
<li>all current <span class="codename">FISH</span> symbols and values</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">When the model state is cleared by use of the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/model/commands/cmd_model.new.html#command:model.new" title="command:model new"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">new</span></code></a> command, all of the above is <em>completely cleared</em> from memory.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-names"><strong>names</strong></dt>
<dd>For certain types of model element objects (like histories, tables, or interfaces) it is convenient to assign a clear short user-assigned name to an object so it can be referred to later.   In general, this is done using a name, which is normally assigned when the object is created.   A name is meant to be a short identifying string, although technically it can be of any length.  As a special case, an integer can be used on the command line as a name, in which case it will be converted automatically into a string.</dd>
<dt id="term-null-zone"><strong>null zone</strong></dt>
<dd>Null zones are zones that represent voids (i.e., no material present) within the finite difference grid.</dd>
<dt id="term-pane"><strong>pane</strong></dt>
<dd>A pane refers to any “page” in the program that appears as a rectangular container that is furnished with its own title bar and open/close controls. Each <a class="reference internal" href="#term-pane-type"><span class="xref std std-term">pane type</span></a> is designed to perform a specific function.</dd>
<dt id="term-pane-menu"><strong>pane menu</strong></dt>
<dd>The set of commands available for the active pane accessed from the pane menu button at the right end of the active pane’s title bar. The commands available from the menu vary with each <a class="reference internal" href="#term-pane-type"><span class="xref std std-term">pane type</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-pane-type"><strong>pane type</strong></dt>
<dd>The common pane types are: <em>Console</em>, <em>Project</em>, <em>Editor</em>, <em>View</em>, <em>Listing</em>,  <em>State Record</em>.  T  The <a class="reference internal" href="program_guide/programwindow/panes_hidingclosing.html#listofclosurestates"><span class="std std-ref">closure state</span></a> of pane types varies, as does access.  <em>Editor</em>, <em>View</em>, and <em>Listing</em> panes, of which there may be multiple instances, are accessed from the <span class="menuselection"><span class="accelerator">D</span>ocuments</span> menu.  All other pane types, of which there is only ever one instance, are accessed from the <span class="menuselection"><span class="accelerator">P</span>anes</span> menu. <span class="flag3">CS: when done come back here and make each pane name a link to the main page for that pane</span></dd>
<dt id="term-plot-file"><strong>plot (file)</strong></dt>
<dd>A “plot file” is a binary file that stores all plot settings of a given plot. Note that the model state information is
not saved in the file, so the same plot file may be used in conjunction with multiple SAV files to create the same
representation of the model at different stages of cycling. A plot file is opened using the “Open Item…” command on the
<em>File</em> menu. Depending on the user’s needs, there are different ways of holding on to plot information for future use.
See Plot Files vs. (Plot) Data Files for more information.</dd>
<dt id="term-plot-term"><strong>plot (term)</strong></dt>
<dd>A plot is a visual representation of the <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model contained in a <em>View</em> pane (to avoid confusion, we do not use the
term “view” to refer to a model visualization since it is the term used to name the pane type that contains the plot).
Typically, plots are composed of plot items and a legend. In <span class="codename">UDEC</span> documentation, when plot is capitalized (PLOT) it
refers to the <strong>PLOT</strong> command, which may be used at the command prompt in the <em>Console</em> to create or manipulate a given view.</dd>
<dt id="term-plot-item"><strong>plot item</strong></dt>
<dd>A plot item is any single visual element that may be added to a plot. The complete list of plot items available in
<span class="codename">UDEC</span> appears in the <em>List</em> tab of the <em>Plot Items</em> control set in the <em>Control Panel</em>.</dd>
<dt id="term-program-state"><strong>program state</strong></dt>
<dd>The program state is all information, settings, or default behaviors that are specific to the <span class="codename">UDEC</span> program itself. This information does not affect (nor is it contained in) either the project state or the model state. Most program state attributes
may be set using the <em>Options</em> dialog.</dd>
<dt id="term-project"><strong>project</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>project</em> refers to the collection of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-46"><span class="xref std std-term">data file</span></a>s and other inputs, and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-save-file"><span class="xref std std-term">save file</span></a>s and other outputs, that comprise a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model.  A project so-defined is stored in a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-project-file"><span class="xref std std-term">project file</span></a>.  The terms “project” and “project file” are so nearly synonymous that they are likely to be used somewhat interchangeably in this documentation.</dd>
<dt id="term-project-pane"><strong>Project (pane)</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>Project</em> pane tracks the input files (data files) and output (model state (SAV)) files created in a single modeling
run. In addition to tracking these items, the pane may be used to open and close files, to determine which files are
available and to navigate between them, and more.</dd>
<dt id="term-project-term"><strong>project (term)</strong></dt>
<dd>The project is a record, kept in a file, that stores/tracks the items that make up a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> modeling simulation.
Project items are not embedded in the project; they are stored as separate files. See
Overview: Projects for a complete description. See
Project Pane to work with projects and items.</dd>
<dt id="term-project-file"><strong>project file</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>project file</em> represents all the files and user interface elements involved in a given <span class="codename">UDEC</span> project, which may involve many different specific models and model states.   The data in a project file is separate from the model state and is not affected by a <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/model/commands/cmd_model.new.html#command:model.new" title="command:model new"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">new</span></code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/model/commands/cmd_model.restore.html#command:model.restore" title="command:model restore"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">restore</span></code></a>.  The project file stores the user-interface layout, the plot files, the data files being edited, and the list of data and save files that have been used or created for the project. See <a class="reference internal" href="program_guide/mechanics/projects/projects.html#projectsmainpage"><span class="std std-ref">Projects</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-project-state"><strong>project state</strong></dt>
<dd>The project state is all information pertinent to the current project (that is, anything that would be recorded
in the project file). The project state is a kind of “wrapper” that may be tracking one or more model states and the
input files used to create it/them. Note that the project may track multiple model states, but only one model state may
be currently open in <span class="codename">UDEC</span> at a time.</dd>
<dt id="term-range"><strong>range</strong></dt>
<dd>A range in a <span class="codename">UDEC</span> model is a filter that restricts the operations of a command to objects that fall within the definition of the filter.  A range <em>may or may not</em> be associated with <em>specific</em> model objects (for example, a range specified in terms of ID numbers or groups will be associated with specific model objects, but a range specified in terms of <span class="tri">x</span>- and <span class="tri">y</span>-coordinates remains fixed in space, so the objects within it at one point of model processing may not be the same as the objects in it at a later point).</dd>
<dt id="term-range-element"><strong>range element</strong></dt>
<dd>A criterion in a range.  Any range will have at least one range element, but may be composed of many range elements, may be designed to be a union or an intersection of the range elements supplied, and may invert any element provided by appending <span class="cmdkey">not</span> at the end of the range element’s specification.</dd>
<dt id="term-result-file"><strong>result file</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>result file</em> is a smaller version of a save file (see above) containing only specific user-specific pieces of information about the model.  Since they are much smaller (generally around 5% of the size of a save file) many more of them may be created without undue use of storage.  A result file may be imported, overwriting the current model state, so that the contents can be visualized.   Result files may be automatically output at user-specified intervals during the calculation.</dd>
<dt id="term-sav-file"><strong>SAV file</strong></dt>
<dd>See <a class="reference internal" href="#term-save-file"><span class="xref std std-term">save file</span></a>.  The file containing the model state at a given moment in model processing. Multiple
SAV files may be generated for a computational model during a simulation.</dd>
<dt id="term-save-file"><strong>save file</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>save file</em> (interchangeably referred to as a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-sav-file"><span class="xref std std-term">SAV file</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="#term-saved-state"><span class="xref std std-term">saved state</span></a>) is a binary file containing the values of all state variables and user-defined conditions up to the current moment of program execution. The primary reason for creating save files is to allow one to investigate the effect of parameter variations without having to rerun a problem completely. A save file can be restored and the analysis continued at a subsequent time (see the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/model/commands/cmd_model.restore.html#command:model.restore" title="command:model restore"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">restore</span></code></a> command). Normally, it is good practice to create several save files during a program run.  <span class="flag2">CS: redo the next two statements after the section on state record is built)</span> <span class="flag3">Save files are created with the :cmd:-model.save- command; if this command is given without a :lkwd:`filename</span> keyword, the default name “UDEC.UDSAV” will be supplied.`  The term <a class="reference internal" href="#term-model-state"><span class="xref std std-term">model state</span></a> may also be used to refer to a saved state (in addition to being, more specifically, the exact state of the model).</dd>
<dt id="term-saved-state"><strong>saved state</strong></dt>
<dd>See <a class="reference internal" href="#term-save-file"><span class="xref std std-term">save file</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-state-record-pane"><strong>State Record (pane)</strong></dt>
<dd>The <em>State Record</em> pane tracks the model state. It provides two views. The <em>Record of Input</em> view displays the commands that make up the current
model state. The <em>List of Input Files</em> view shows the files that have been used to make up the current state.</dd>
<dt id="term-state-record-term"><strong>state record (term)</strong></dt>
<dd>A state record is a transcription of the steps that have gone into the creation of the current model state. The state
record is tracked in the <em>State Record</em> pane (see above), and may be exported for later use. An exported state record
may be loaded into <span class="codename">UDEC</span> and should, in all cases, create and return the entire model to its exact state at the moment
the file was created.</dd>
<dt id="term-static-solution"><strong>static solution</strong></dt>
<dd>A static or steady-state solution is reached when the rate of change of kinetic energy in a model approaches a negligible value. This is accomplished by damping the equations of motion. At the conclusion of the static solution stage, the model will either be at a state of equilibrium or at a state of steady flow of material if a portion (or all) of the model is unstable (i.e., fails) under the applied loading conditions.  Static mechanical solutions can be coupled to transient groundwater flow or heat transfer solutions. (As an option, fully dynamic analysis can also be performed by inhibiting the static solution damping.)</dd>
<dt id="term-step"><strong>step</strong></dt>
<dd>Because <span class="codename">UDEC</span> is an explicit code, the solution to a problem requires a number of computational steps. During computational stepping, the information associated with the phenomenon under investigation is propagated across the zones in the finite difference grid. A certain number of steps is required to arrive at an equilibrium (or steady-flow) state for a static solution. Typical problems are solved within 2000 to 4000 steps, although large complex problems can require tens of thousands of steps to reach a steady state. When using the dynamic analysis option, <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/model/commands/cmd_model.step.html#command:model.step" title="command:model step"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">step</span></code></a> refers to the actual timestep for the dynamic problem. Other terms for step are timestep and cycle.</dd>
<dt id="term-structural-element"><strong>structural element</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Structural elements are available in <span class="codename">UDEC</span>. Two-noded, linear elements represent the behavior of beams, cables, rockbolts, and supports.  Structural elements are used to simulate the interaction of structural support within a soil or rock mass. Nonlinear material behavior can be represented with some of the elements.</p>
<p class="last">Each structural element entity (beam, cable, rockbolt, or support) is composed of two or three components: nodes; individual elements; and node/block interfaces.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-switch"><strong>switch</strong></dt>
<dd>See the term attribute.</dd>
<dt id="term-table-file"><strong>table file</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>table file</em> is a formatted ASCII file created by exporting a table using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/table_manual/table_commands/cmd_table.export.html#command:table.export" title="command:table export"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">table</span> <span class="pre">export</span></code></a> command.  This table may be modified by the user and imported into another model state using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/table_manual/table_commands/cmd_table.import.html#command:table.import" title="command:table import"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">table</span> <span class="pre">import</span></code></a> command.  The table file format is simple and easy to create from spreadsheets or other ASCII data. It specifies a single sequence of (<span class="tri">x</span>,<span class="tri">y</span>) value pairs, either at regular or irregular <span class="tri">x</span>-intervals.</dd>
<dt id="term-title-bar"><strong>title bar</strong></dt>
<dd>All panes in <span class="codename">UDEC</span> and the program’s main window have a title bar. The title bar appears at the top of the pane,
contains a label that indicates the content of the pane and provides controls to minimize/hide, maximize/restore
and/or close the window (which of these controls is present depends on the pane’s type).</dd>
<dt id="term-toolbar"><strong>toolbar</strong></dt>
<dd>There is one toolbar in the program. It appears adjacent to the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-main-menu"><span class="xref std std-term">main menu</span></a>. It can be repositioned as desired within the program’s main window.  The contents of the toolbar are contextual to the currently active pane, and will change when the active <a class="reference internal" href="#term-pane-type"><span class="xref std std-term">pane type</span></a> changes. Each pane also allows for a local copy of the toolbar be loaded directly beneath its title bar, via the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-pane-menu"><span class="xref std std-term">pane menu</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-unbalanced-force"><strong>unbalanced force</strong></dt>
<dd>The unbalanced force indicates when a mechanical equilibrium state (or the onset of plastic flow) is reached for a static analysis. A model is in exact equilibrium if the net nodal-force vector (the resultant force) at each gridpoint is zero. The maximum nodal-force vector is monitored and printed to the screen when the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/model/commands/cmd_model.step.html#command:model.step" title="command:model step"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">step</span></code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/model/commands/cmd_model.solve.html#command:model.solve" title="command:model solve"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">solve</span></code></a> command is invoked. The maximum nodal force vector is also called the <em>unbalanced</em> or <em>out-of-balance</em> force. The maximum unbalanced force will never exactly reach zero for a numerical analysis, but the model is considered to be in equilibrium when the maximum unbalanced force is small compared to the total applied forces in the problem. If the unbalanced force approaches a constant nonzero value, this probably indicates that failure and plastic flow are occurring within the model. When a gridpoint is fixed in a given direction, the component of the unbalanced force in that direction is equivalent to the reaction force.</dd>
<dt id="term-user-data-file"><strong>user data file</strong></dt>
<dd><span class="codename">UDEC</span> currently supports three types of user-defined data types.  Scalar fields, vector fields, and tensor fields.  These data types support both export and import into custom ASCII file formation, via the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/data/commands/cmd_data.scalar.import.html#command:data.scalar.import" title="command:data scalar import"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">data</span> <span class="pre">scalar</span> <span class="pre">import</span></code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../../../kernel/doc/manual/data/commands/cmd_data.scalar.export.html#command:data.scalar.export" title="command:data scalar export"><code class="xref fish fish-cmd docutils literal"><span class="pre">data</span> <span class="pre">scalar</span> <span class="pre">export</span></code></a> commands (for example).  These are used primarily to record possible model data or to compare against data generated outside <span class="codename">UDEC</span> (like seismic events imported as scalar data).</dd>
<dt id="term-vector-image"><strong>vector image</strong></dt>
<dd>A vector image is any kind of image that uses mathematically described primitives for representation. The most
immediate advantage of vector images over raster (or “bitmap”) images is that vectors are easily scalable since
they do not have a “resolution” that is device-dependent. <span class="codename">UDEC</span> can produce two types of vector images,
Drawing Exchange Format (DXF) and Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML). It also produces two types of compound images (vector with
the ability to include/embed raster content), PDF and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).</dd>
<dt id="term-view-pane"><strong>View (pane)</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>View</em> pane is a pane that contains a plot. “Plot” refers to the image that appears within a <em>View</em>.</dd>
<dt id="term-zone"><strong>zone</strong></dt>
<dd>The finite difference zone is the smallest geometric domain within which the change in a phenomenon (e.g., stress versus strain) is evaluated.</dd>
<dt id="term-75"><strong>zone</strong></dt>
<dd>A zone is the smallest geometric domain within which the change in a phenomenon (e.g., stress versus strain)
is evaluated in <span class="codename">UDEC</span>. Polyhedral zones of different shapes (e.g., brick, wedge, pyramid, and tetrahedral-shaped
zones) are used to create models. Another term for zone is “element.”</dd>
