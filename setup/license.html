<p>The second screen of the program installation presents the end user license agreement. Installation cannot proceed until it is accepted. Installation of the software, therefore, constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions of the agreement. It is reproduced here for your convenience.</p>
<p class="h2 rubric">Itasca Software License Agreement</p>
<p><em>Please read the following terms and conditions of this agreement carefully before using the program.</em></p>
<p><em>Installation of the code onto your computer indicates your acceptance of the terms and conditions in this agreement.</em></p>
<p><em>If you do not agree with these terms and conditions, please cancel this installation.</em></p>
<p>This software program is provided by Itasca Consulting Group, Inc. (“Itasca”) or one of its authorized
suppliers. Title to the media on which the software is recorded and to the documentation in support
thereof is transferred to the customer, but title to the software is retained by Itasca. Itasca and its
licensors own all intellectual property in the software. Itasca permits you to use the software only in
accordance with the terms of this agreement. You assume responsibility for the selection of the software
to achieve your intended results and for the installation of the software, the use of and the results
obtained from the software.</p>
<p><span class="bi">LICENSE</span></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>All Itasca software (with the exception of Demonstration Versions, see below) are secured and require a hardware lock to cycle.</li>
<li>A standard single license allows up to two instances of the software to cycle on a single computer. A Network Version (see below) allows one instance of the software, per seat, to cycle on any computer connected to the network.</li>
<li>You may not use, copy, modify, or transfer the software, or any copy, in whole or part, except as expressly provided in this document.  You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software to obtain the source code of the software.</li>
<li>You may not sell, sub-license, rent, or lease this software.</li>
<li>Licenses are not transferable outside the purchasing organization, company, institution, or corporation. Licenses sold to private individuals are not transferable under any terms.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bi">TERMS</span></p>
<p>The license is effective as indicated under the purchasing terms or until terminated. You may terminate
it any time by destroying the software together with any back-up copies and returning the hardware lock.
It will also terminate if you fail to comply with any term or condition of this agreement. You agree upon
such termination to destroy the software together with any back-up copies, modifications, and/or merged
portions in any form and return the hardware lock to Itasca.</p>
<p><span class="bi">WARRANTY</span></p>
<p>Itasca will correct any errors in the software at no charge for twelve (12) months after the purchase
date of the software. Notification of a suspected error must be made in writing, with a complete listing
of the input and output files and description of the error. If, in the judgment of Itasca, the software
does contain an error, Itasca will (at its option) correct or replace the copy at no cost to the user or
refund the initial purchase price of the software.</p>
<p><span class="bi">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</span></p>
<p>Itasca assumes no liability whatsoever with respect to any use of the software or any portion thereof or
with respect to any damages or losses that may result from such use, including (without limitation) loss
of time, money or goodwill that may arise from the use of the software (including any modifications or
updates that may follow). In no event shall Itasca be responsible for any indirect, special, incidental
or consequential damages arising from use of the software.</p>
<p><span class="bi">EXPORT</span></p>
<p>You may not ship, transfer, or export into any country the software or its updates in any manner
prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws or restrictions. In
addition, you represent and warrant that you are not a citizen of, or located within, an embargoed nation
and that you are not otherwise prohibited under United States Export Laws to receive the software. Rights
to use the software are forfeited for failure to comply with this agreement.</p>
<p><span class="bi">HARDWARE LOCKS</span></p>
<p>Title to the hardware lock(s) associated with a license belongs to Itasca. You are wholly responsible to
maintain and safeguard the hardware lock. Itasca reserves the right to determine the cost of replacing a
lost or stolen hardware lock, up to and including the cost of a new license.</p>
<p><span class="bi">UPDATES AND UPGRADES</span></p>
<p>If the software is an update or an upgrade to a previous version, you must possess a valid license to the
previous version. Any update or upgrade provided for a previous version is subject to the terms of this
agreement. You may continue to use previous versions provided that (a) it is necessary to use the
previous version to read or otherwise use outputs from that version of the program, (b) you do not
transfer the previous version to another party, and (c) you acknowledge that any obligation that Itasca
has to support the previous version of the program may end upon obtaining the update or upgrade.</p>
<p><span class="bi">NETWORK VERSIONS</span></p>
<p>If and only if the license is a network version, the terms of this agreement apply in all respects with
the following exception: the software may be used concurrently on the number of machines for which the
program has been licensed and as allowable by the program’s hardware lock.</p>
<p><span class="bi">DEMONSTRATION VERSIONS</span></p>
<p>If and only if the software is used in demonstration mode, the terms of this agreement apply in all
respects with the following exceptions. The software is provided “AS-IS” and Itasca bears no
responsibility to provide support for the software. The software shall be operable without a hardware
lock. You acknowledge that the software may contain bugs, errors or other problems for which Itasca
disclaims any warranty or liability obligations.</p>
<p><span class="bi">SOFTWARE SUPPORT</span></p>
<p>FItasca will provide support
for the current release version as well as for the version immediately preceding the current version for
12 months after release of the current version.</p>
<p>Software support includes providing email and telephone support, at no charge, to assist the software
owner in the installation of the software on the owner’s computer system. Additionally, general
assistance may be provided in aiding the owner in understanding the capabilities of the various features
of the software. However, no-cost assistance is not provided for help in applying Itasca Software to
specific user-defined problems.</p>
<p>Technical support covering modeling questions, applications, definitions, interpretation of results,
design guidelines, etc., can be purchased on
an as-needed basis. For users who envisage the need for substantial amounts of assistance, consulting
support is available. In all instances, the user is encouraged to send the problem description to Itasca
by fax or electronic mail in order to minimize the amount of time spent trying to define the problem.</p>
<p>Itasca reserves the right to determine what qualifies as no-cost assistance and what requires payment.</p>
